        This is my corner of the internet. Here, I display my web development
        skills, for both potential employers and to impress family members and
        friends.

      <p>
        My favorite web development framework is
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vuejs.org">Vue</a>
        although I also have experience with Angular. I enjoy being creative
        with CSS and learning more about the web development ecosystem. The
        content on these pages reflect my interest and ability to build
        interesting things. You can look at the source code for this website
        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sealep/paul-seale">here</a>
        if you are interested.
